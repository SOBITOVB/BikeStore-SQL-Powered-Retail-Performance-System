# BikeStore-SQL-Powered-Retail-Performance-System
Built a SQL Server–based BI system for a bike retail dataset.  Tech: SQL Server • T-SQL • SSMS • BULK INSERT • Stored Procedures • Data Modeling • KPI Reporting

Built a SQL Server–based BI system for a bike retail dataset, designing a normalized data model with 9 core tables across sales/production schemas.

Implemented CSV ingestion using staging tables + BULK INSERT, including type conversions and basic data quality validation.

Developed business KPI queries (e.g., Total Revenue, AOV, Inventory Turnover, Revenue by Store/Category/Brand) using joins and aggregations.

Created reusable stored procedures for analytics workflows: GetStoreKPI, GetRestockList, GetYearlyComparison, and GetCustomerProfile.

Packaged the solution as deployable SQL scripts with clear structure for reuse and extension (views/SQL Agent automation can be added).
